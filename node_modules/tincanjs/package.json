  "readme": "A JavaScript library for implementing Tin Can API.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RusticiSoftware/TinCanJS.png)](https://travis-ci.org/RusticiSoftware/TinCanJS)\n\nFor hosted API documentation, basic usage instructions, supported version listing, etc. visit the main project website at:\n\nhttp://rusticisoftware.github.io/TinCanJS/\n\nFor more information about the Tin Can API visit:\n\nhttp://tincanapi.com/\n\nBrowser Usage\n-------------\n\nTinCanJS is available via Bower.\n\nThe browser environment is well tested and supports two kinds of Cross Origin requests which\nis sufficient to cover most versions of Chrome, FireFox, Safari as well as IE 8+. IE 6+ are\nsupported for non-CORS (because they don't support it).\n\nInclude *one* of build/tincan-min.js or build/tincan.js as follows:\n\n    <script src=\"build/tincan-min.js\"></script>\n\nNode.js Usage\n-------------\n\nTinCanJS is available via `npm`.\n\nThe `Environment/Node.js` wrapper used in this version has a dependency on the 'xhr2' module\nwhich is also available via `npm`. It is used to allow the interfaces to the underlying LRS\nrequests to have the same API. As such currently there is no support for synchronous requests\nwhen using this environment.\n\nInstall via:\n\n    npm install tincanjs\n\nAnd within code:\n\n    var TinCan = require('tincanjs');\n\nEnvironments\n------------\n\nImplementing a new Environment should be straightforward and requires overloading a couple\nof methods on the `TinCan.LRS` prototype. There are currently two examples, `Environment/Browser`\nand `Environment/Node`.\n",
